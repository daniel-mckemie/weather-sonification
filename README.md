# Weather Sonification App

A data sonifier built in React, that reads the weather based on City/Country or Zip Code within the United States.  Returns real-time weather information from the Open Weather Map and sonifies it using the Web Audio API/R-Audio library.

The goal of this project is to lay the groundwork to build out larger and more involved applications to sonify data.  Future work will include the soification of non-numerical data (clear sky, snow showers, etc.) and a system that updates in real-time.
